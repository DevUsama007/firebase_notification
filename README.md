# Firebase Notification Project Overview

Key Features
1. Complete Firebase Notification Setup

   • Configuration files

   • Firebase SDK integration

   • Initialization code

2. Notification Handling in All App States

   • Active state - Foreground notification handling

   • Background state - Background message handling

   • Killed state - Notification handling when app is terminated

3. Server-Side Components

   • Code to obtain the Firebase Cloud Messaging API (V1) server key/token

   • Implementation for sending notifications between devices

4. Client-Side Components

   • Device token/ID retrieval

   • User permission requests for notifications

   • Notification display handling

Technical Implementation
 Your project likely includes:
   • Android (Java/Kotlin) and/or iOS (Swift/Objective-C) implementations
   • Firebase console configuration instructions
   • Server-side code (possibly Node.js, Python, or other backend language) for sending notifications
   • Proper handling of notification payloads (data vs notification messages)
   • Deep linking implementation (if clicking notifications opens specific app content)
Potential Use Cases
 This implementation would be valuable for:
   • Chat applications
   • Alert systems
   • Update notifications
   • Marketing communications
   • Any app requiring real-time messaging
